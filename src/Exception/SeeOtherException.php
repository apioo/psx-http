 * The response to the request can be found under a different URI and SHOULD be
 * retrieved using a GET method on that resource. This method exists primarily
 * to allow the output of a POST-activated script to redirect the user agent to
 * a selected resource. The new URI is not a substitute reference for the
 * originally requested resource. The 303 response MUST NOT be cached, but the
 * response to the second (redirected) request might be cacheable.
