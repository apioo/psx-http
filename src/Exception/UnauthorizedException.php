/**
 * The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a
 * WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.47) containing a challenge
 * applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with
 * a suitable Authorization header field (section 14.8). If the request already
 * included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that
 * authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response
 * contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has
 * already attempted authentication at least once, then the user SHOULD be
 * presented the entity that was given in the response, since that entity might
 * include relevant diagnostic information.
