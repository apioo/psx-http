/**
 * The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state
 * of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where it is expected
 * that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request.
 * The response body SHOULD include enough information for the user to recognize
 * the source of the conflict. Ideally, the response entity would include enough
 * information for the user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that
 * might not be possible and is not required.
