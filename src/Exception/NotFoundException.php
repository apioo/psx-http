/**
 * The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication is
 * given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The 410 (Gone)
 * status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally
 * configurable mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and
 * has no forwarding address. This status code is commonly used when the server
 * does not wish to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no
 * other response is applicable.
